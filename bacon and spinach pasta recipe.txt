Ingredients:
6 oz. bacon (1/2 12oz. pkg)
1 small onion
2 cups chicken broth
1/2 lb. pasta
1/4 lb. (3-4 cups) fresh spinach
1/3 cup grated Parmesan

Directions:
1) Cut the bacon across the strips into one-inch sections. Saute the bacon
 in a large skillet until it is brown and crispy (no extra fat needed). Carefully 
pour the fat off into a bowl, leaving about one tablespoon in the skillet.

2) While the bacon cooks, dice the onion. Once the bacon fat is drained from 
the skillet, add the diced onions and saute until they are soft and transparent. 
Allow the moisture from the onions to dissolve some of the browned bits off of 
the bottom of the skillet.

3) Add two cups of chicken broth to the skillet and dissolve off any remaining 
browned bits of bacon drippings from the bottom of the skillet.

4) Finally, add the pasta to the skillet, place a lid on top, and let the 
skillet come to a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, turn the heat down 
to low and let simmer for 15 minutes. Give the skillet a quick stir to loosen 
the pasta from the bottom every five minutes or so, replacing the lid quickly 
each time. After 15 minutes the pasta should be tender and most of the broth 
absorbed. There should be a little bit of thick, saucy broth remaining in 
the bottom of the skillet.

5) Add the fresh spinach to the skillet and stir until it has wilted into 
the pasta. Turn off the heat, sprinkle the Parmesan over top, stir to combine, 
and then serve.
